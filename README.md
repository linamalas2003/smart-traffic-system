Developed an AI-powered traffic management system to address urban traffic congestion. The project integrated YOLOv8 for real-time vehicle detection and SUMO for traffic modeling. A dynamic algorithm optimized traffic light timings based on detected traffic density, reducing congestion and wait times. A user-friendly dashboard was designed to display real-time statistics such as vehicle counts and average wait times, enabling effective traffic monitoring.
